            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>A person like me comes along one in a lifetime, and I have always thought about how to use my gift. I asked a question, How do I make a video game? <br />
            So I watched a video that answered me <br />
            Right here <br />
            <iframe width="420" height="315"
                    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ex1ktxOxVgI"></iframe> <br />
            I watched this and...*thx sound plays and me smiling* I knew it would be possible, and it could be done, so i made my choice <br />
            <strong>I am making a game</strong> <br />
            So i researched, i found some sources, mostly <a href="https://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> <br />
            They had a javascript programming class, it is ProgrammingJS, so i could only show off my javascript if I had to include some library woop-woop. <br />
            Im sure theres a way, but a way that makes SENSE! Anyways, I kept learning, found my tools, and now, I made a website, several games and everything, I started my career early! <br />
            But thats enough about me. Go make a game! Or just play mine for now. But I will be expecting a site of your OWN with games!! /;) <br />
            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/719571114/">Here, play this.</a></p>
