            Expect plenty of PC and Android games, Javascript thingies, and ample amounts of Scratch games! In fact, heres Episode 1 of my series, GenPopToons. <br /><iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/718754391/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

            <h1>Can I be like you?</h1>
            <p>Of course, if you put heaps of effort into something, it will look like you put lots of effort. <br />
            If you put lots of effort into learning how to make something like this, and making it, then your outcome will loook like you put that effort in <br />
            The short answer, Yes, if you learn as much as you can like I did. This isnt even a SCHOOL thing!</p>
